143,Same here This delta variant is super contagious My husband and I both got it after being vaccinated in March It wasn t confirmed to be delta but that s my best guess based on symptoms more cold like no cough and the fact that we had breakthrough cases I ve been trying to warn all my vaccinated friends that it s time to start being extra cautious again,6

145,I do think it is a bit strange though You say that you know of many in healthcare system saying that the vaccine shot directly resulted in blood clots and miscarriages The reason I find it odd is that now with more studies done on a sizable population of pregnant people in the States other countries have since rolled it out to the pregnant people and have not reported the same observation that your healthcare friends are seeing Even in places where there is a bigger transparency from their government and media of any ill effects even if rare But I do think that if you have had COVID then it will provide some protection But I heard that part of the reason why they recommend it to even those who have been infected and recovered naturally is that with different people they have varying amounts of antibodies that wane with some faster than others It is difficult to tell without taking blood to test how much is still in the system at a given point It is not a standard time frame for all With that said I understand the hesitancy,5

249,10 10 recommend getting the vaccine n nI got both doses of Moderna while pregnant No issues no side effects They just tested my LO for antibodies at her 4 month appointment yesterday and the antibody test came back with a strong positive so she has some protection The doctor said she likely got some through cord blood and continues to get antibodies through breastmilk,6

255,Also not trying to scare anyone who wants to become pregnant That totally fine just sharing that it was more anxiety inducing than I expected My only hesitancy would be getting sick while pregnant I just delivered in May and like PP said just one support person and my husband couldn t come to my last several appointments However they don t really know how this virus or the vaccine since they aren t currently including pregnant persons in trials impacts the fetus There is some indication that having Covid while pregnant can cause placental damage So delivering and hunkering down was okay for us but being anxious a full 9 months isn t for me,3

257,My little 2 month baby girl is going through some sort of phase where she wouldn t drink a lot of milk She s taking 2 5 maybe 3 oz per feed 7 feeds a day Which means she only having 20 to 22 oz of milk per day n nShe s wetting enough diapers but definitely not having a great appetite Her appetite went downhill ever since her 2 month vaccines exactly a week ago n nShe would fight the bottle and I don t wanna force feed n nLet me know how much your little ones are taking And any recommendations on how I could possibly help I ve overcome this in order to take in more milk She s a smaller baby too so this worries me,1
259,My son is scheduled for his 1 year vaccines tomorrow and my pediatrician said he will be getting 5 vaccines She mentioned that the other doctors don t do 5 at one time and prefer to space it out She said they will give some now and the rest at 18 months I m not seeing her tomorrow due to her being on maternity leave but she said I can tell them to do all 5 now Her reasoning is because at 18 months they remember more whereas 12 months they don t What are your thoughts and how many vaccines did your baby get at 12 months,4
261,My doctor told me to go ahead and get it while it is available to me I saw some people said that we shouldn t get it in the first trimester but she said it wouldn t be a difference She said many babies have died in the womb due to the mother having Covid It seems like a hard decision to make because we don t know the effects the vaccine will have on the baby either,3

263,I like having information and research For example I haven t been comfortable getting the COVID vaccine while pregnant Maybe I ll get it in the third trimester n nBut for vaccines for baby I feel VERY comfortable with the level of evidence safety and support I will be giving baby all vaccines on the recommended schedule as well as getting the DTaP vaccine myself while pregnant and getting the flu vaccine while pregnant If it s available before baby comes since I m due in September n nAgain I am a cautious person but I will be following the vaccine schedule for my baby and not have any hesitancy about it I have spent a lot of time reading about and researching vaccines,6

277,Also you can t compare flu to whopping cough its two different animals Flu shot is up to 60 effective babies cant get it till 6 months of age and they can get actual flu anytime after birth vs first 2 months of age This is why so many more babies die because of the flu 20 babies dying from a highly preventable disease is still too much Thats someone else child to them they are everything Thats because Tdap is highly effective If you get this shot during pregnancy you have 80 chance your baby will not get whopping cough Then at 2 months of age the baby gets his own vaccine for it which is again highly effective We are much more prepared to prevent infection from whopping cough then we are for the flu The flu mutates every single year,6

309,Especially if I had previously felt the pain of a loss If I was super uncomfortable and even contemplating bringing on labour in a dangerous way like consuming caster oil I would want every woman in here to tell me I was crazy to even think about risking my rainbow and myself Using drugs drinking smoking not vaccinating and trying to induce labour are all subjects which will get you judged from here to the ends of the earth because you re going against medical research which has proven known or unknown risks to the unborn child I don t want to live in or be part of a world where we are each others cheer leaders while we risk our lives and our babies lives using home remedies instead of seeking medical assistance to bring on labour I ve no idea which threads you re referring to We re a tough crowd but only when it comes to mummy and baby health I ve never been pulled up or pulled anyone up on their spelling nor have I witnessed it in any of the threads With being dyslexic I am at the mercy of autocorrect and sometimes it s not worth googling a word to get it right,0

317,I know it s easier said than done but the best advice would be to tell her no Have your mom over just don t tell MIL about it Don t let MIL+entourage come over Tell them right now that Christmas is a no go too and tell them that anyone who isn t vaccinated is totally unwelcome in your home at the very least until flu season is completely over Being that firm is really hard and it can be really emotionally troubling but honestly I think that if you can do that then it s probably the best course of action If IF you let your MIL come for thanksgiving tell her that ONLY she can come not the others that SHE has to bring the main course rather than a side dish and I d ask your husband to go out a day or two early and pick up some pre made sides and tell your MIL that she has to be ok with unpacked boxes and store bought sides and with you not being a waitress or a maid And tell her that if she bitches even once or makes even one passive aggressive comment then she can go straight back home Again that s if you decide to let her come over,2

325,i tested positive for covid 11 22 but i think i had it the friday before that my kids had rsv the week before so i was assuming it was me catching that until my boss texted me that i was exposed and needed to get tested my daughter is 2 5 she started showing symptoms 6 days after me my son started showing symptoms like two days ago for me it was a cough extreme fatigue nausea loss of appetite and worrying of course my daughter has been congested for about a week and complained of a headache one night my son has some minor congestion other than that they re both themselves they re playing and smiling and no fevers yet when my daughter has rsv it turned into an ear infection and she literally didn t leave the couch for two full days she looked like hell my son s cough was miserable with it too so far this is much milder for them the one thing that absolutely sucks that i m still dealing with is my milk supply totally tanked i used to be able to pump 7 10oz in 5 minutes i m lucky to get 2oz in a power pumping session an hour long at this point so hopefully you re not breastfeeding or if you are make sure you have something to give baby in case your supply drops for a little my supply is very slowly starting to come back i masked up lysoled like crazy wore a robe over my clothes when i held baby slept separately but once my toddler got it i knew the baby would have it my husband is vaccinated and still not showing symptoms,2

405,I think the whole process was safe really It was really effective and got a lot of people vaccinated in a systematic controlled way And we of course had the questionnaire to fill out beforehand Have you ever had an allergic reaction to a vaccine If the answer is yes then you don t qualify for a drive through vaccine Someone did honk their horn while I was there a few cars behind me The paramedic just talked to them they never got out of their car or anything I got the impression it was just anxiety related since they never needed any advanced care n nLooking at vaers data the risk of death from covid is still higher than having a serious effect from vaccination hospitalization anaphylaxis or death so using that data to justify not getting a vaccine when you have no other preexisting condition is a no from me dawg n,6

409,So it took a week after his shots for the side effects to occur then about 4 days for them to finally subside We went in for his shots on a Wednesday and the next Wednesday evening into Thursday 1 week later is when he developed his fever and very mild rashes I called the doctor that Friday and they said that it was completely normal and to call back on Monday if he was still feeling grouchy had a fever more worsening rashes Sure enough by Monday he was pretty much back to normal The doctor strongly believed the side effects were due to the MMR rather than Varicella but it could have been either one or both that caused his reaction My son got his Varicella and MMR vaccines at the same time a couple months ago About 1 week later he developed a small rash in maybe 3 different spots of his body nothing major Along with those little rashes he developed a 101 4 fever almost exactly 1 week after the vaccinations as well,1

week A smaller but important part of our circle n nMy side of the family is full of conspiracy theorists who don t believe the pandemic is real My family is large n n3 Mom step dad brother Caught covid last year They take some precautions due to moms health but think the vaccine and masks is a government conspiracy Due to this we only see them occasionally My brother frequently visits his dad and if we have multiple parties to lessen the crowds he will be at both parents houses n n4 Dad stepmom 2 sisters 3 step siblings Caught covid last year all of them live in a huge house takes no precautions frequent partiers thinks the whole pandemic is fake Due to this we rarely see them When I do see them then they suddenly care about the pandemic and are super careful around the baby because she s a baby I guess I do respect that My sisters frequently visit my mom and would be at both parties if we have one at moms and one at dads n n5 Grandma grandpa They are very vulnerable and take the pandemic very seriously We have seen them maybe twice over the past year briefly because they miss us a ton and wanted to stop by for Christmas and thanksgiving Both times my grandma left

uncomfortable with that size of party I told him I respected that I suggested splitting the party up one for his side and one for mine to make it a little smaller Most celebrations we ve ever had were just his family anyway It can be a bit hard to have a small party with my side of the family because my parents divorced and have blended families Lots of kids But I thought this may help a little My husband agreed it made him feel a little better We both have some guilt about the exclusion of my family over the past year n nIn response my in laws threw a total fit They said it was unfair to leave them out and since my family was bigger they feel my family will get the main party and theirs will not be My husband told them my family never gets to be involved and to have some perspective My in laws didn t understand so I explained what I had definitely avoided advertising to anyone to prevent any family drama my family does not believe in the pandemic n nMy in laws felt frustrated with that but do not want to get sick They said they understand now why we split it but to think carefully before bringing our daughter into that I reluctantly agreed My in laws do not want to attend parties with my family now n nSo then I split the party into 3 One at dads house One at moms house One at GMIL house This makes all gatherings small nMy grandma and grandpa can choose which place to go but would probably go to their sons my dad s house n nWell now my mom and dad are unhappy Since my siblings go between mom and dad s house they would be at both parties on my side and this leaves us only excluding mom and my step dad n nI feel awful for how this whole thing is going I try so hard to no exclude people I wish people would just do what they were supposed to do with the CDC guidelines If everyone was vaccinated this wouldn t be a problem I don t know how to go about this in any other way besides a way that leaves everyone equally disappointed Or is it I don t know Maybe my mom is getting the short end of the stick here n nEveryone involved is adults yes legit all of my siblings are adults living with their parents I m the only one that moved out so the park wouldn t really be the best my daughter is too young to do much there I don t know guys Is there a better way to do this Should I scrap the whole thing I don t exactly want to have a birthday celebration where half the

533,I agree with others I m not a nurse or dr but I have a bunch in the family all have worked with covid patients for a period and luckily none of them have had covid thanks to early vaccination and PPE If you got your last vaccine back in winter spring I might suggest asking your OB to give you the green light for a booster sooner rather than later just because of your work environment to ensure you have the highest antibodies possible Try not to stress too much I m sure you know better than most masking and vaccination make a huge difference As long as your hospital has correct procedures in place to contain covid spread you should be relatively safe Best of luck,6

895,Thank you all so much for your responses It s interesting just how many babies react negatively to the vaccine and yet doctors act like it s not possible My son finally pooped last night but at the very end of the evening It was the biggest blowout he s ever had and dark green mucus y He was miserable all day until then This is definitely not normal for him so I think we will be skipping the next dose at his next appointment or in the very least scheduling it later,6

911,We are officially 3 months out which some refer to as the fourth trimester I can t believe our sweet boy is no longer in the newborn stage They weren t lying when they said time goes by so fast n nI have shared our story once before but ended up deleting it because as soon as I posted it a flood of emotions came rushing back and I decided I wasn t really ready to share However I want to share to bring awareness and in hopes that others may relate to my story and realize they aren t alone n nMost would say I had a pretty easy pregnancy and I would have to agree with that physically However I struggled for weeks on end mentally I was so ridden with anxiety and worry that some days I didn t feel like getting out of bed I have previously been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and pregnancy increased that almost ten fold I was constantly worried if my baby was okay if I was okay I worried about every single move I made every single food I put into my body every single product I used on my skin hair etc Yes I know it s good to worry about that stuff however it became an unhealthy obsession I would obsessively scroll through the internet and google and would convince myself of the worst case scenario I was in one of the worst places mentally I had ever really been It was hard Really hard I finally came to the decision with the help of my doctors that it was time to go back on my anxiety medication I was anxious about going back on my medication to help with my anxiousness but ultimately it was the best decision for both me and my baby n nI thought that when I wasn t pregnant anymore things would improve dramatically However our birth story proved me wrong On the night of November 22nd 2 days before baby was born I started having lower back pain and my legs ached I was almost 38 weeks along and brushed it off to pregnancy pains The next morning November 23rd the pains got worse I had my 38 week appointment later that day so I took some Tylenol and tried to rest As the day went on something felt really wrong I checked my temperature and it was 101 I called My husband and told him that he needed to come pick me up because I didn t feel comfortable driving to the hospital and meeting him like we had originally planned n nWhen we arrived at my appointment later that day I had high blood pressure protein in my urine brisk reflexes and baby s heart rate was high Something I was terrified of happening my entire pregnancy happened I was showing signs of pre eclampsia n nWe were sent down to the OBGYN emergency department to be checked out When I arrived there my resting heart rate was 143 BPM my temperature had spiked to 102 8 and urine tests confirmed I had pre eclampsia The medical team was trying to figure out why I was feeling so poor and why my temperature was so high A little while later one of my other fears came true I had tested positive for COVID Being vaccinated and not having any knowledge of being exposed I was in shock However this diagnosis helped our medical team take care of me and work to get both baby and I more stabilized They acted quickly and hooked me up to meds It was then decided I was going to be induced either that night or the next morning Again another fear coming true n nWe were admitted to the hospital and transferred to labor and delivery I continued meds and they monitored baby and I closely My husband and I were obviously not allowed to leave the room because I was positive for COVID My mom wasn t able to come to the hospital We also did not have any of our stuff Luckily our bags were pretty much packed and we had help from our sweet neighbors and friend to make sure the rest of our stuff got packed and they delivered it to the hospital for us n nThe next morning November 24th I was induced We attempted a vaginal delivery however I ended up needing a C Section Trying to give birth while being sick from COVID was quite the experience After a very difficult labor and delivery sparing a lot of details but my epidural failed At 5 37 nPM that day our beautiful boy entered the world He was safe and healthy If he would have had to go to the NICU we would not have been able to be with him Thankfully that didn t happen During the C Section I lost a lot of blood I remember being terrified sick and overwhelmed Luckily we had an amazing team of doctors and nurses who took great care of me and baby n nRecovery was rough I don t think I need to go into detail on that Being stuck in a hospital room for 3 days and not even being able to walk out in the hallway was rough Not being able to have my mom there was rough nThe whole situation just completely sucked However baby was healthy and happy and that s all that mattered n nWhen we got home I was terrified of giving my baby COVID I wore a mask when I fed him and pretty much the whole time I was around him I worried every single second about my newborn child getting sick Although there was a chance of him getting sick the doctors were optimistic about him being totally fine since he was getting antibodies through breast milk and from me having the vaccine Thankfully he did not get COVID If he did he was completely asymptomatic n nI was not only anxiety ridden about that but worried about my health My husband had to give me shots to prevent blood clots for 2 weeks I was constantly checking my blood pressure because I was scared Constantly checking my heart rate Being postpartum having surgery and having COVID had me a complete mess n nI would love to say I m completely back to normal but I m not It may take me a while to get there I feel like I m getting better each day This may not be the case in other people s eyes but my birth experience was traumatic Yes my son was happy and healthy but the whole experience was terrifying and obviously not something we were prepared for It seemed like everything that could go wrong went wrong I truly believe God and some amazing guardian angels were watching over us during that time n nI ve spent a lot of time being angry sad confused about why our experience went the way it did However I m so grateful for our amazing medical team Our nurses doctors and everyone we came in contact with at the hospital was outstanding They helped put us at ease during a really scary time I m so grateful for my husband who was my rock through this and put his own emotions on the back burner to be strong for me He carried me through a horrible labor and never let go of my hand He was an absolute champ n nI m so grateful our baby was healthy I know in some situations that s not always the case I keep telling myself it could have been so much worse and yes it could have BUT that doesn t make our experience and feelings any less important Sometimes I feel guilty for complaining n nI m sharing in hopes of reaching someone who had a traumatizing birth experience Someone who had an anxiety ridden pregnancy Someone who struggles with post partum anxiety Someone who wishes their experience would ve been different nI thank God every day for my healthy beautiful baby but it s time to start shedding light on traumatizing birth experiences and talking about pregnancy and post partum anxiety,4

It may take me a while to get there I feel like I m getting better each day This may not be the case in other people s eyes but my birth experience was traumatic Yes my son was happy and healthy but the whole experience was terrifying and obviously not something we were prepared for It seemed like everything that could go wrong went wrong I truly believe God and some amazing guardian angels were watching over us during that time n nI ve spent a lot of time being angry sad confused about why our experience went the way it did However I m so grateful for our amazing medical team Our nurses doctors and everyone we came in contact with at the hospital was outstanding They helped put us at ease during a really scary time I m so grateful for my husband who was my rock through this and put his own emotions on the back burner to be strong for me He carried me through a horrible labor and never let go of my hand He was an absolute champ n nI m so grateful our baby was healthy I know in some situations that s not always the case I keep telling myself it could have been so much worse and yes it could have BUT that doesn t make our experience and feelings any less important Sometimes I feel guilty for complaining n nI m sharing in hopes of reaching someone who had a traumatizing birth experience Someone who had an anxiety ridden pregnancy Someone who struggles with post partum anxiety Someone who wishes their experience would ve been different nI thank God every day for my healthy beautiful baby but it s time to start shedding light on traumatizing birth experiences and talking about pregnancy and post partum anxiety,2
912,We are officially 3 months out which some refer to as the fourth trimester I can t believe our sweet boy is no longer in the newborn stage They weren t lying when they said time goes by so fast n nI have shared our story once before but ended up deleting it because as soon as I posted it a flood of emotions came rushing back and I decided I wasn t really ready to share However I want to share to bring awareness and in hopes that others may relate to my story and realize they aren t alone n nMost would say I had a pretty easy pregnancy and I would have to agree with that physically However I struggled for weeks on end mentally I was so ridden with anxiety and worry that some days I didn t feel like getting out of bed I have previously been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and pregnancy increased that almost ten fold I was constantly worried if my baby was okay if I was okay I worried about every single move I made every single food I put into my body every single product I used on my skin hair etc Yes I know it s good to worry about that stuff however it became an unhealthy obsession I would obsessively scroll through the internet and google and would convince myself of the worst case scenario I was in one of the worst places mentally I had ever really been It was hard Really hard I finally came to the decision with the help of my doctors that it was time to go back on my anxiety medication I was anxious about going back on my medication to help with my anxiousness but ultimately it was the best decision for both me and my baby n nI thought that when I wasn t pregnant anymore things would improve dramatically However our birth story proved me wrong On the night of November 22nd 2 days before baby was born I started having lower back pain and my legs ached I was almost 38 weeks along and brushed it off to pregnancy pains The next morning November 23rd the pains got worse I had my 38 week appointment later that day so I took some Tylenol and tried to rest As the day went on something felt really wrong I checked my temperature and it was 101 I called My husband and told him that he needed to come pick me up because I didn t feel comfortable driving to the hospital and meeting him like we had originally planned n nWhen we arrived at my appointment later that day I had high blood pressure protein in my urine brisk reflexes and baby s heart rate was high Something I was terrified of happening my entire pregnancy happened I was showing signs of pre eclampsia n nWe were sent down to the OBGYN emergency department to be checked out When I arrived there my resting heart rate was 143 BPM my temperature had spiked to 102 8 and urine tests confirmed I had pre eclampsia The medical team was trying to figure out why I was feeling so poor and why my temperature was so high A little while later one of my other fears came true I had tested positive for COVID Being vaccinated and not having any knowledge of being exposed I was in shock However this diagnosis helped our medical team take care of me and work to get both baby and I more stabilized They acted quickly and hooked me up to meds It was then decided I was going to be induced either that night or the next morning Again another fear coming true n nWe were admitted to the hospital and transferred to labor and delivery I continued meds and they monitored baby and I closely My husband and I were obviously not allowed to leave the room because I was positive for COVID My mom wasn t able to come to the hospital We also did not have any of our stuff Luckily our bags were pretty much packed and we had help from our sweet neighbors and friend to make sure the rest of our stuff got packed and they delivered it to the hospital for us n nThe next morning November 24th I was induced We attempted a vaginal delivery however I ended up needing a C Section Trying to give birth while being sick from COVID was quite the experience After a very difficult labor and delivery sparing a lot of details but my epidural failed At 5 37 nPM that day our beautiful boy entered the world He was safe and healthy If he would have had to go to the NICU we would not have been able to be with him Thankfully that didn t happen During the C Section I lost a lot of blood I remember being terrified sick and overwhelmed Luckily we had an amazing team of doctors and nurses who took great care of me and baby n nRecovery was rough I don t think I need to go into detail on that Being stuck in a hospital room for 3 days and not even being able to walk out in the hallway was rough Not being able to have my mom there was rough nThe whole situation just completely sucked However baby was healthy and happy and that s all that mattered n nWhen we got home I was terrified of giving my baby COVID I wore a mask when I fed him and pretty much the whole time I was around him I worried every single second about my newborn child getting sick Although there was a chance of him getting sick the doctors were optimistic about him being totally fine since he was getting antibodies through breast milk and from me having the vaccine Thankfully he did not get COVID If he did he was completely asymptomatic n nI was not only anxiety ridden about that but worried about my health My husband had to give me shots to prevent blood clots for 2 weeks I was constantly checking my blood pressure because I was scared Constantly checking my heart rate Being postpartum having surgery and having COVID had me a complete mess n nI would love to say I m completely back to normal but I m not

959,The most I ve seen is delayed ovulation if a dose was received close to the normal time of ovulation So a slightly longer cycle than normal I would guess pretty much all of them ended up pregnant between doses or shortly after receiving their 2nd dose Then again your body would have that reaction with just about anything Normal illnesses stress etc n nFor me I did see a slight elevation in my BBT chart following my first dose No idea if it actually delayed my cycle or not because I got the dose around the time I would have ovulated pre pregnancy but my cycle was still regulating postpartum from my first and the previous cycles I had been ovulating 5 days later than I was pre pregnancy The cycle I got vaccinated my ovulation followed that same pattern so no idea if it was just a coincidence or what It s entirely possible that my body would have ovulated those 5 days later regardless of having the vaccine We ll never know because I got pregnant that same cycle,6
