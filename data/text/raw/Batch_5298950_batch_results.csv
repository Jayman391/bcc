Fair enough...both have now happened. Yet people are now throwing out statistics and saying the vaccinated are still getting sick, and it hasn't been long enough, and well let's just hope they're right. \n\nI won't lie; I admit I was terrified to get the vaccine. These feelings are valid. We have the freedom to say no. \n\nBut make sure your saying no to the truth and proof. Dont say no because you heard from a friends cousins wife that it causes miscarriages. Or you read a post that said 'its still killing everyone so there's no point'. Or ""my sister got covid and she's fine so its not as bad as you think"". These are conspiracy theories floating through the world that we read or hear and automatically believe. \n\nMy dad, a nurse, calls it the truth and proof method.

How many posts and comments have we seen in the past few months ths that have said "" I'll wait for FDA approval"" and "" I'll wait a few months after people give birth to see their outcome""? Fair enough...both have now happened. Yet people are now throwing out statistics and saying the vaccinated are still getting sick, and it hasn't been long enough, and well let's just hope they're right. \n\nI won't lie; I admit I was terrified to get the vaccine. These feelings are valid. We have the freedom to say no. \n\nBut make sure your saying no to the truth and proof. Dont say no because you heard from a friends cousins wife that it causes miscarriages. Or you read a post that said 'its still killing everyone so there's no point'. Or ""my sister got covid and she's fine so its not as bad as you think"". These are conspiracy theories floating through the world that we read or hear and automatically believe. \n\nMy dad, a nurse, calls it the truth and proof method. Find out what is true based on proof. And find proof to make it truth. Then make a decision.

After reading the horror stories of pregnant women getting sick, my son being back in school, and my boyfriend working in a busy restaurant and refusing the vaccine due to a needle phobia (fyi: restaurants in the Chicago area are not making their employees get vaccinated), I decided I'd rather just do it to be safe.

Remind her that if she really cares about you and her grandchildren then she needs to respect your wishes and leave you alone and stop showing up at your house everyday. You need your privacy. If she can't do that, and it comes to drastic measures, you can call the police to have her removed from your property (or even threaten to call them just so she'll leave on her own). They won't arrest her for trespassing as long as she leaves when they ask her to. I know that sounds really harsh and can cause a slew of problems, which is why you should save it as a last resort.\n\nI really hope you get this resolved.

Highly recommend checking it out if you're nervous about getting vaccinated. OP - maybe share with your partner? The sources are linked in the article and I quoted some key parts below.\n\nPersonally I got the Pfizer shot at 6 and 9 weeks. I'm 25.5 now and baby is great. I feel kicks all the time. This pregnancy comes after a miscarriage at the end of 2019 and it's been long hard road to get here. Protecting this baby and my unvaccinated 7yo is why I got the shots.\n\nFrom the article:\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also recently recommended that pregnant women receive the vaccine.\n\n""These studies are huge and have substantial numbers,"" said Sabra Klein, co-director of the Center for Women's Health, Sex and Gender Research at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ""This is data that you can believe in, and I think the message is very clear: If you are pregnant and not vaccinated, you should get vaccinated. You should be more afraid of this virus, especially these new variants, than you should be of the vaccine.""\n\nA study from the University of California, San Francisco, released earlier this month found that the risk of pre-term births at less than 32 weeks was 60 percent higher among people infected by Covid during pregnancy, and the risk of giving birth at less than 37 weeks was 40 percent higher. The risk was also substantially higher among those who had hypertension, diabetes or obesity.\n\nDeborah Karasek, an obstetrics and gynecology assistant professor and researcher with the California Preterm Birth Initiative at UCSF, led the study, which analyzed more than 240,000 births in California that occurred between July 2020 and January 2021, including nearly 9,000 cases in which the woman was diagnosed with Covid during pregnancy.\n\n""Our study is representative of all the births in the state of California, so there's less potential for bias because it's a population-based study,"" Karasek said. ""Our findings really build on a large body of evidence that we're seeing within the public health and medical community, and so I think taken together it really supports that we're seeing adverse effects of Covid infection in pregnancy.""\n\nA study from researchers at the University of Washington found that pregnant women did not have harmful or severe side effects from receiving the vaccination.

Highly recommend checking it out if you're nervous about getting vaccinated. OP - maybe share with your partner? The sources are linked in the article and I quoted some key parts below.\n\nPersonally I got the Pfizer shot at 6 and 9 weeks. I'm 25.5 now and baby is great. I feel kicks all the time. This pregnancy comes after a miscarriage at the end of 2019 and it's been long hard road to get here. Protecting this baby and my unvaccinated 7yo is why I got the shots.\n\nFrom the article:\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also recently recommended that pregnant women receive the vaccine.\n\n""These studies are huge and have substantial numbers,"" said Sabra Klein, co-director of the Center for Women's Health, Sex and Gender Research at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ""This is data that you can believe in, and I think the message is very clear: If you are pregnant and not vaccinated, you should get vaccinated. You should be more afraid of this virus, especially these new variants, than you should be of the vaccine.""\n\nA study from the University of California, San Francisco, released earlier this month found that the risk of pre-term births at less than 32 weeks was 60 percent higher among people infected by Covid during pregnancy, and the risk of giving birth at less than 37 weeks was 40 percent higher. The risk was also substantially higher among those who had hypertension, diabetes or obesity.\n\nDeborah Karasek, an obstetrics and gynecology assistant professor and researcher with the California Preterm Birth Initiative at UCSF, led the study, which analyzed more than 240,000 births in California that occurred between July 2020 and January 2021, including nearly 9,000 cases in which the woman was diagnosed with Covid during pregnancy.\n\n""Our study is representative of all the births in the state of California, so there's less potential for bias because it's a population-based study,"" Karasek said. ""Our findings really build on a large body of evidence that we're seeing within the public health and medical community, and so I think taken together it really supports that we're seeing adverse effects of Covid infection in pregnancy.""\n\nA study from researchers at the University of Washington found that pregnant women did not have harmful or severe side effects from receiving the vaccination. More than 17,000 people participated in the study.\n\nExperts agree these findings show a clear correlation, and some view them as a call for more pregnant people to get the vaccination to protect themselves and their children.","covid19_coronavirus_support","2021-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","8","sacu","a77399398","USA","comment",,,"NA","No information about the author’s vaccine intentions"

Flu shot is up to 60% effective, babies cant get it till 6 months of age and they can get actual flu anytime after birth vs first 2 months of age.

There have been slightly less than 300 cases in the US. the median age of the affected children was 2 years and 2 months and none of these children were breastfed after 12 months of age. In other words, a vaccinated mother breastfeeding their child is not the reason these kids are sick. Even though the cause of the unknown hepatitis is not known they have found several different types of adenoviruses. The .

They have not noticed a pattern between the J&J adenovirus and the adenoviruses (several different ones )  found in the children.

I had a pounding headache for a couple of days and cold symptoms for a couple of weeks, was more tired than normal, but apart from that all fine and totally back to normal now. 3x vaccinated luckily and I wouldn't like to think how bad it might have been if I wasn't or if I had caught one of the earlier strains. But the most you can do is take precautions and hope for the best. I just hope some of my antibodies have passed onto the baby so they'll have a little protection when they come out .

This is our first child. I did not get a baby shower. I missed out on anyone being there for the birth. Now I don't know what's happening with the first birthday. \n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nThere are 5 households that make up the immediate family. \n\nMy husband's side is fully vaccinated, but a small family\n\n1. GMIL/GFIL: A major part of our circle, the main sitter for our daughter. We see them almost daily.\n\n2. MIL/FIL: Live in another part of the state. They come to visit roughly every week to every other week. A smaller, but important part of our circle.\n\nMy side of the family is full of conspiracy theorists who don't believe the pandemic is real. My family is large.\n\n3. Mom/step dad/brother: Caught covid last year. They take some precautions due to moms health, but think the vaccine and masks is a government conspiracy. Due to this we only see them occasionally. My brother frequently visits his dad and if we have multiple parties to lessen the crowds he will be at both parents houses.\n\n4: Dad/stepmom/2 sisters/ 3 step siblings: Caught covid last year (all of them). live in a huge house, takes no precautions, frequent partiers, thinks the whole pandemic is fake. Due to this we rarely see them. When I do see them then they suddenly care about the pandemic and are super careful around the baby...because she's a baby. I guess I do respect that. My sisters frequently visit my mom and would be at both parties if we have one at moms and one at dads. \n\n5. Grandma/grandpa: They are very vulnerable and take the pandemic very seriously. We have seen them maybe twice over the past year briefly because they miss us a ton and wanted to stop by for Christmas and thanksgiving. Both times my grandma left crying for having to cut the visit short. She is very family oriented. She wouldn't miss my daughters birthday for the world.\n\nMy husband and I take the pandemic seriously. We are fully vaccinated. I feel myself beginning to crack for desperately wanting normalcy. We sometimes make exceptions against CDC guidelines against our better judgement just to see someone once in a while (maybe every other month), especially with a baby who is growing up so far not knowing or barely knowing the majority of her family. We have always kept these visits short and in small groups only. I am really struggling with this as this pandemic goes on and on.\n\nTHE PROBLEM:\n\nSince everyone has either had Covid or is fully vaccinated, I was planning an outdoor party with everyone. My husband told me he was uncomfortable with that size of party. I told him I respected that. I suggested splitting the party up- one for his side and one for mine to make it a little smaller. Most celebrations we've ever had were just his family anyway. It can be a bit hard to have a small party with my side of the family because my parents divorced and have blended families. Lots of kids. But I thought this may help a little. My husband agreed it made him feel a little better. We both have some guilt about the exclusion of my family over the past year. \n\nIn response, my in laws threw a total fit. They said it was unfair to leave them out and since my family was bigger, they feel my family will get the ""main"" party and theirs will not be. My husband told them my family never gets to be involved, and to have some perspective. My in laws didn't understand, so I explained what I had definitely avoided advertising to anyone to prevent any family drama: my family does not believe in the pandemic.\n\nMy in laws felt frustrated with that, but do not want to get sick. They said they understand now why we split it, but to think carefully before bringing our daughter into that. I reluctantly agreed. My in laws do not want to attend parties with my family now.\n\nSo then I split the party into 3. One at dads house. One at moms house. One at GMIL house. This makes all gatherings small.\nMy grandma and grandpa can choose which place to go, but would probably go to their sons, my dad's, house.\n\nWell now my mom and dad are unhappy. Since my siblings go between mom and dad's house they would be at both parties on my side, and this leaves us only excluding mom and my step dad.\n\nI feel awful for how this whole thing is going. I try so hard to no exclude people. I wish people would just do what they were supposed to do with the CDC guidelines. If everyone was vaccinated this wouldn't be a problem. I don't know how to go about this in any other way besides a way that leaves everyone equally disappointed. Or is it? I don't know. Maybe my mom is getting the short end of the stick here.\n\nEveryone involved is adults (yes legit all of my siblings are adults living with their parents, I'm the only one that moved out) so the park wouldn't really be the best...my daughter is too young to do much there.

This is our first child. I did not get a baby shower. I missed out on anyone being there for the birth. Now I don't know what's happening with the first birthday. \n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nThere are 5 households that make up the immediate family. \n\nMy husband's side is fully vaccinated, but a small family\n\n1. GMIL/GFIL: A major part of our circle, the main sitter for our daughter. We see them almost daily.\n\n2. MIL/FIL: Live in another part of the state. They come to visit roughly every week to every other week. A smaller, but important part of our circle.\n\nMy side of the family is full of conspiracy theorists who don't believe the pandemic is real. My family is large.\n\n3. Mom/step dad/brother: Caught covid last year. They take some precautions due to moms health, but think the vaccine and masks is a government conspiracy. Due to this we only see them occasionally. My brother frequently visits his dad and if we have multiple parties to lessen the crowds he will be at both parents houses.\n\n4: Dad/stepmom/2 sisters/ 3 step siblings: Caught covid last year (all of them). live in a huge house, takes no precautions, frequent partiers, thinks the whole pandemic is fake. Due to this we rarely see them. When I do see them then they suddenly care about the pandemic and are super careful around the baby...because she's a baby. I guess I do respect that. My sisters frequently visit my mom and would be at both parties if we have one at moms and one at dads. \n\n5. Grandma/grandpa: They are very vulnerable and take the pandemic very seriously. We have seen them maybe twice over the past year briefly because they miss us a ton and wanted to stop by for Christmas and thanksgiving. Both times my grandma left crying for having to cut the visit short. She is very family oriented. She wouldn't miss my daughters birthday for the world.\n\nMy husband and I take the pandemic seriously. We are fully vaccinated. I feel myself beginning to crack for desperately wanting normalcy. We sometimes make exceptions against CDC guidelines against our better judgement just to see someone once in a while (maybe every other month), especially with a baby who is growing up so far not knowing or barely knowing the majority of her family. We have always kept these visits short and in small groups only. I am really struggling with this as this pandemic goes on and on.\n\nTHE PROBLEM:\n\nSince everyone has either had Covid or is fully vaccinated, I was planning an outdoor party with everyone. My husband told me he was uncomfortable with that size of party. I told him I respected that. I suggested splitting the party up- one for his side and one for mine to make it a little smaller. Most celebrations we've ever had were just his family anyway. It can be a bit hard to have a small party with my side of the family because my parents divorced and have blended families. Lots of kids. But I thought this may help a little. My husband agreed it made him feel a little better. We both have some guilt about the exclusion of my family over the past year. \n\nIn response, my in laws threw a total fit. They said it was unfair to leave them out and since my family was bigger, they feel my family will get the ""main"" party and theirs will not be. My husband told them my family never gets to be involved, and to have some perspective. My in laws didn't understand, so I explained what I had definitely avoided advertising to anyone to prevent any family drama: my family does not believe in the pandemic.\n\nMy in laws felt frustrated with that, but do not want to get sick. They said they understand now why we split it, but to think carefully before bringing our daughter into that. I reluctantly agreed. My in laws do not want to attend parties with my family now.\n\nSo then I split the party into 3. One at dads house. One at moms house. One at GMIL house. This makes all gatherings small.\nMy grandma and grandpa can choose which place to go, but would probably go to their sons, my dad's, house.\n\nWell now my mom and dad are unhappy. Since my siblings go between mom and dad's house they would be at both parties on my side, and this leaves us only excluding mom and my step dad.\n\nI feel awful for how this whole thing is going. I try so hard to no exclude people. I wish people would just do what they were supposed to do with the CDC guidelines. If everyone was vaccinated this wouldn't be a problem. I don't know how to go about this in any other way besides a way that leaves everyone equally disappointed. Or is it? I don't know. Maybe my mom is getting the short end of the stick here.\n\nEveryone involved is adults (yes legit all of my siblings are adults living with their parents, I'm the only one that moved out) so the park wouldn't really be the best...my daughter is too young to do much there. I don't know guys. Is there a better way to do this? Should I scrap the whole thing? I don't exactly want to have a birthday celebration where half the family isn't included. My husband says even if we do a backyard party we will eventually end up inside...","relationships_and_family_talk_formerly_aitf","2021-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","NA","grizzlymonkey","","USA","post","https://community.babycenter.com/post/a77270884/first-birthday-party-drama","First birthday party drama","40","Vaccinated/planning to vaccinate"

I have a situation. I'm scheduled to have a c section on Friday at 37 weeks due to chronic hypertension and baby being breech. My fluid levels are also super high. I have a four year old son but he was induced so this is my first c section... definitely a little nervous given the circumstances. I found out yesterday my son's babysitter has Covid, so he is officially in quarantine. The original plan was for him to stay with grandparents while my husband stayed with me at the hospital but obviously I no longer feel comfortable with that plan.

I have a situation. I'm scheduled to have a c section on Friday at 37 weeks due to chronic hypertension and baby being breech. My fluid levels are also super high. I have a four year old son but he was induced so this is my first c section... definitely a little nervous given the circumstances. I found out yesterday my son's babysitter has Covid, so he is officially in quarantine. The original plan was for him to stay with grandparents while my husband stayed with me at the hospital but obviously I no longer feel comfortable with that plan.

He works a job where he is in contact with many customers in a day, I asked if he could start wearing his mask again just out of caution for me & the baby since cases are rising again & he said he doesn't want to and isn't going to.

It seemed like she was in pain. She had fever 100,4 from Monday evening till Tuesday morning, and she wakes up almost every hour and cried.\nOn Tuesday she felt a little bit better, fever was lower, and she slept a little bit better and didn't wake up that often but fuzz a lot.\n\nI hoped that today she would be ok, but unfortunately my baby is miserable. She slept longer than usual in the morning. Early in the morning she had a mild fever, and once she waked up for the day she had no fever. At the midday she got sleepy and started to cry. She only wants to sleep in my arms when I stand and rock her. I try to lay holding her on my chest, but she wakes up and fuzzes until I stand up and rock her to sleep. \n\nAlso it looks like she has some issues with her stomach.

He was involved in all of the kids lives and I took to a lot of the same interests as him. Always a solid relationship. Until I had my son. \n\nIn Sept 2020, my brother and his now wife got married with a backyard wedding for about 50 guests. This was obviously before vaccines and with many people we didnt know. I was 37 weeks pregnant at the time and my dad has congestive heart failure. My doctor recommended that if it was important to me, to go to the ceremony, keep my distance and leave before dinner and dancing to avoid being in contact with anyone that might have COVID. That's what my husband and I did. We had mentioned to my dad that if he felt uncomfortable and wanted to leave earlier than my mom, we would be willing to drop him off at home or bring him to our house. The day after the wedding, my dad blew up on me about how I need to stop being selfish and acting like my mom doesnt care about me or the baby and that they had every right to stay as long as they wanted at the wedding. This was completely left field and really threw me for a loop. Despite being pregnant I was very logical in my response and even reached to my mom to apologize if I had done or said anything to hurt her feelings recently. My dad was just super nasty and never apologized. He didnt talk to me until I went into labor 3 weeks later and basically brushed it under the rug. \n\nFast forward to tonight. I decided last week to get rid of my social media for a little bit. I've been dealing with really bad post partum depression and anxiety still and the social media didnt help. I get the following text from my dad: \n""Hmmm. No more [grandson] snaps? No more OP snaps? Your not even on my board! What's going on little girl? Please tell me I'm not shut out!"" \nDespite being offended that he called me little girl (I'm about to be 30), I responded light heartedly with: \n""Lol you're not shut out! I'm taking a social media hiatus. Here's a cute pic of DS from yesterday though. "" \n\nThis was his response: \nAny reason? I feel bad about this. Did I do something wrong. I just think about how [my uncle, moms brother] just zones people out. First it was Grandma. Then it was [my other uncle]. And now it's Mom.  I see how much it hurts Mom and just don't understand why people do this. There's a real lack of love in the world right now. Great picture though! I always remember when we were in a funk, and you told me that you would decide who DS would meet. I remember that every day. It honestly affects my feelings for DS. I'm not gonna let my daughter hurt me. This isn't a game. This is life. I don't know how long I'm gonna live. I'm your Dad and I love you! "" \n\nNever once did I say that I would decide who gets to meet my son. Even though I have every right to. I dont even know what to say. My son turns 1 next month and the thought being around either of my parents makes me sick. But if I uninvite them to the party, they will 100% guilt family members into not going as well. \n\nHow do I even respond to that text? I feel like I have failed my son so badly giving him such crappy extended family. He deserves so much better.

I know this can be a controversial topic so not looking to discuss or debate whether or not babies should be vaccinated/immunized, as it is each parent's right to choose and decide this for their child (or at least it is in my country).\nWe have decided to have our son vaccinated and he has his first appointment for them today (he is 6 weeks). I am keen to hear from others who have recently been through this.\nHow did your baby respond? What were they like the days following?

I can't believe our sweet boy is no longer in the newborn stage. They weren't lying when they said time goes by so fast.\n\nI have shared our story once before, but ended up deleting it because as soon as I posted it, a flood of emotions came rushing back and I decided I wasn't really ready to share. However, I want to share to bring awareness and in hopes that others may relate to my story and realize they aren't alone.\n\nMost would say I had a pretty ""easy"" pregnancy, and I would have to agree with that, physically. However, I struggled for weeks on end mentally. I was so ridden with anxiety and worry that some days I didn't feel like getting out of bed. I have previously been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, and pregnancy increased that almost ten fold. I was constantly worried if my baby was okay, if I was okay. I worried about every single move I made, every single food I put into my body, every single product I used on my skin, hair, etc. Yes, I know it's good to worry about that stuff; however, it became an unhealthy obsession. I would obsessively scroll through the internet and google and would convince myself of the worst case scenario. I was in one of the worst places mentally I had ever really been. It was hard. Really hard. I finally came to the decision, with the help of my doctors, that it was time to go back on my anxiety medication. I was anxious about going back on my medication to help with my anxiousness, but ultimately, it was the best decision for both me and my baby.\n\nI thought that when I wasn't pregnant anymore, things would improve dramatically. However, our birth story proved me wrong. On the night of November 22nd (2 days before baby was born), I started having lower back pain and my legs ached. I was almost 38 weeks along, and brushed it off to pregnancy pains. The next morning, November 23rd, the pains got worse. I had my 38 week appointment later that day, so I took some Tylenol and tried to rest. As the day went on, something felt really wrong. I checked my temperature, and it was 101. I called My husband and told him that he needed to come pick me up because I didn't feel comfortable driving to the hospital and meeting him like we had originally planned. \n\nWhen we arrived at my appointment later that day, I had high blood pressure, protein in my urine, brisk reflexes, and baby's heart rate was high. Something I was terrified of happening my entire pregnancy happened.. I was showing signs of pre-eclampsia. \n\nWe were sent down to the OBGYN emergency department to be checked out. When I arrived there, my resting heart rate was 143 BPM, my temperature had spiked to 102.8, and urine tests confirmed I had pre-eclampsia. The medical team was trying to figure out why I was feeling so poor, and why my temperature was so high. A little while later, one of my other fears came true... I had tested positive for COVID. Being vaccinated and not having any knowledge of being exposed, I was in shock. However, this diagnosis helped our medical team take care of me and work to get both baby and I more stabilized. They acted quickly and hooked me up to meds. It was then decided I was going to be induced either that night or the next morning. Again, another fear coming true.\n\nWe were admitted to the hospital and transferred to labor and delivery. I continued meds and they monitored baby and I closely. My husband and I were obviously not allowed to leave the room because I was positive for COVID. My mom wasn't able to come to the hospital. We also did not have any of our stuff. Luckily, our bags were pretty much packed and we had help from our sweet neighbors and friend to make sure the rest of our stuff got packed and they delivered it to the hospital for us.\n\nThe next morning, November 24th, I was induced. We attempted a vaginal delivery; however, I ended up needing a C-Section. Trying to give birth while being sick from COVID was quite the experience! After a very difficult labor and delivery (sparing a lot of details, but my epidural failed). At 5:37\nPM that day, our beautiful boy entered the world. He was safe and healthy. If he would have had to go to the NICU, we would not have been able to be with him. Thankfully, that didn't happen. During the C-Section, I lost a lot of blood. I remember being terrified, sick, and overwhelmed. Luckily, we had an amazing team of doctors and nurses who took great care of me and baby.\n\nRecovery was rough. I don't think I need to go into detail on that. Being stuck in a hospital room for 3 days and not even being able to walk out in the hallway was rough. Not being able to have my mom there was rough.\nThe whole situation just completely sucked. However, baby was healthy and happy and that's all that mattered. \n\nWhen we got home, I was terrified of giving my baby COVID. I wore a mask when I fed him and pretty much the whole time I was around him. I worried every single second about my newborn child getting sick. Although there was a chance of him getting sick, the doctors were optimistic about him being totally fine since he was getting antibodies through breast milk and from me having the vaccine. Thankfully, he did not get COVID. If he did, he was completely asymptomatic.\n\nI was not only anxiety ridden about that, but worried about my health. My husband had to give me shots to prevent blood clots for 2 weeks. I was constantly checking my blood pressure because I was scared. Constantly checking my heart rate. Being postpartum, having surgery, and having COVID had me a complete mess.\n\nI would love to say I'm completely back to normal but I'm not. It may take me a while to get there. I feel like I'm getting better each day. This may not be the case in other people's eyes, but my birth experience was traumatic. Yes, my son was happy and healthy, but the whole experience was terrifying and obviously not something we were prepared for. It seemed like everything that could go wrong, went wrong. I truly believe God and some amazing guardian angels were watching over us during that time.\n\nI've spent a lot of time being angry, sad, confused about why our experience went the way it did. However, I'm so grateful for our amazing medical team. Our nurses, doctors, and everyone we came in contact with at the hospital was outstanding. They helped put us at ease during a really scary time. I'm so grateful for my husband, who was my rock through this and put his own emotions on the back burner to be strong for me. He carried me through a horrible labor and never let go of my hand. He was an absolute champ.\n\nI'm so grateful our baby was healthy. I know in some situations, that's not always the case. I keep telling myself ""it could have been so much worse"", and yes, it could have. BUT.. that doesn't make our experience and feelings any less important. Sometimes I feel guilty for complaining.\n\nI'm sharing in hopes of reaching someone who had a traumatizing birth experience. Someone who had an anxiety ridden pregnancy. Someone who struggles with post-partum anxiety. Someone who wishes their experience would've been different.\nI thank God every day for my healthy, beautiful baby.. but it's time to start shedding light on traumatizing birth experiences and talking about pregnancy and post-partum anxiety.","december_2021_birth_club","2022-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","86","amandamacim","","USA","post","https://community.babycenter.com/post/a77638376/long-post-ahead-birth-experience-with-covid","Long post ahead.
